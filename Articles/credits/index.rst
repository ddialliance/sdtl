Structured Data Transformation Language (SDTL) was created by the
Continuous Capture of Metadata for Statistical Data
(C\ :sup:`2`\ Metadata) Project funded by National Science Foundation
(ACI-1640575). Defining SDTL was a cooperative activity to which all
members of the project contributed.

The C\ :sup:`2`\ Metadata Project will end in 2020. Long-term
responsibility for maintaining and expanding SDTL has moved to the DDI
Alliance, which established an SDTL Working Group.
