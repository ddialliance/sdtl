# SDTH Model Specification
## Programs and Program Steps {#model-programs}
### sdth:Program {#model-program} 
An sdth:Program is a set of instructions that modify data.   An sdth:Program consists of sdth:ProgramSteps.
sdth:Program is a sub-class of prov:entity, prov:plan, and provone:Program. 

**has super-class**
- prov:Entity, prov:Plan, provone:Program

**is in domain of**
- sdth:hasProgramStep


###  sdth:ProgramStep {#model-programstep}
An sdth:ProgramStep is an operation in an sdth:Program.  An sdth:ProgramStep may be associated with a single command in a program or script.   However, sdth:ProgramStep is recursive, which means that an sdth:ProgramStep may be linked to other sdth:ProgramSteps using sdth:hasProgramStep. This allows complex operations to be represented as a set of simpler operations.
sdth:ProgramStep is a subclass of prov:Activity

## Data Entities {#model-data-entities}
###  sdth:FileInstance {#model-fileinstance}
An sdth:FileInstance is a persistent version of an sdth:DataframeInstance stored on a medium, such as a disk, tape, CD-ROM, or non-volatile memory storage device.  The data in an sdth:FileInstance is stored in columns (variables) and rows.  sdth:FileInstances may be in a variety of formats.  File formats used by statistical analysis programs usually store some metadata about variables, such as data type and label.  Simple formats, like comma-separated values (CSV), which contain very little metadata describing the meaning and attributes of values, may be accompanied by a separate metadata file. 

An sdth:FileInstance is created by an sdth:ProgramStep that executes an operation represented as an sdth:savesFile. 

When an sdth:loadsFile is executed, the contents of sdth:FileInstance becomes an sdth:DataframeInstance.
The sdth:VariableInstances in an sdth:FileInstance are enumerated using sdth:hasVarInstance.

**has super-class**
- prov:Entity, provone:Data

**is in domain of**
- sdth:hasName, sdth:hasVarInstance, sdth:wasDerivedFrom, sdth:elaborationOf

**is in range of**
- sdth:loadsFile, sdth:savesFile, sdth:wasDerivedFrom, sdth:elaborationOf


###  sdth:DataframeInstance {#model-dataframeinstance} 
An sdth:DataframeInstance is a two-dimensional matrix of data values created in a computer memory during the execution of an sdth:Program.  An sdth:DataframeInstance is a transient object that disappears when execution of the sdth:Program ends.
sdth:DataframeInstances consist of columns and rows.  The columns in an sdth:DataframeInstance are sdth:VariableInstances.  The rows may be considered observations or cases. 

An sdth:DataframeInstance may be created by an sdth:ProgramStep that executes an sdth:loadsFile or an sdth:producesDataframe.

Any change in one of the sdth:VariableInstances in an sdth:DataframeInstance  procudes a new sdth:producesDataframe.

The sdth:VariableInstances in an sdth:DataframeInstance are enumerated using sdth:hasVarInstance.


**has super-class**
- prov:Entity, provone:Data

**is in domain of**
- sdth:hasName, sdth:hasVarInstance, sdth:wasDerivedFrom, sdth:elaborationOf

**is in range of**
- sdth:producesDatframe, sdth:consumesDataframe, sdth:wasDerivedFrom, sdth:elaborationOf


 
###  sdth:VariableInstance  {#model-variableinstance}
An sdth:VariableInstance refers to a set of values and their associated metadata appearing in a column of an sdth:DataframeInstance or sdth:FileInstance.  Metadata associated with an sdth:VariableInstance can include data type (text, numeric, etc.), number of decimal places, or a value schema for a categorical variable.  The order of observations in an sdth:DataframeInstance or sdth:FileInstance is also an attribute of every sdth:VariableInstance.

An sdth:VariableInstance is immutable. When a data transformation command changes any aspect of an sdth:VariableInstance, it generates a new sdth:VariableInstance.  This includes changing any of the values in an sdth:DataframeInstance or any of the attributes of those values.  Sorting an sdth:DataframeInstance also results in a new set of sdth:VariableInstances.   This is necessary, because some data transformation commands use the order of rows in a dataframe in computations, such as the lag() function in statistical analysis programs like SAS and Stata.

An sdth:VariableInstance may appear in more than one sdth:DataframeInstance or sdth:FileInstance.  For example, if one value in an sdth:VariableInstance changes, a new sdth:DataframeInstance is generated, but the new sdth:DataframeInstance contains all of the sdth:VariableInstances in the previous sdth:DataframeInstance except the one that was changed.  When an sdth:DataframeInstance is saved to an sdth:FileInstance, the sdth:VariableInstances in the sdth:FileInstance are the same as those in the sdth:DataframeInstance. 

The sdth:VariableInstance is a specialization of the PROV entity. Although PROV does not require all aspects of a prov:entity to be fixed, the purposes of SDTH require complete immutability.

The SDTH definition of an sdth:VariableInstance is synonymous with the definition of an “Instance Variable” in GSIM (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), 2024) and a “Variable” in DDI Life Cycle (DDI Alliance, 2024). 

An sdth:VariableInstance is an instantiation of the ddi-cdi:InstanceVariable and is associated with a specific set of DDI-CDI “datums” (ref DDI-CDI).  A ddi-cdi:InstanceVariable specifies attributes of the values of a variable, such as a data type and value schema, but it is not limited to a specific set of values.

- prov:Entity, provone:Data

**is in domain of**
- sdth:hasName, sdth:wasDerivedFrom, sdth:elaborationOf

**is in range of**
- sdth:hasVarInstance, sdth:wasDerivedFrom, sdth:elaborationOf


###  sdth:hasName  {#model-hasname}
sdth:hasName specifies a name for a data entity.  All data entities in SDTH are expected to have names.  A name links an SDTH data entity to the object that it represents in a script or program code.

**has range**
- xsd:string

 
## File and Dataframe Operations {#model-files}
### sdth:loadsFile {#model-loadsfile}
When a sdth:ProgramStep executes an sdth:loadsFile operation, an external sdth:FileInstance is loaded into the active workspace as a DataframeInstance.  A sdth:ProgramStep that executes a sdth:loadsFile command also performs an sdth:producesDataframe operation. 

**has domain**
- sdth:ProgramStep

**has range**
- sdth:FileInstance

 
### sdth:savesFile {#model-savesfile}
When a sdth:ProgramStep executes an sdth:savesFile operation, an external sdth:FileInstance is created.  A sdth:ProgramStep that executes a sdth:savesFile command also performs an sdth:consumesDataframe operation.

**has domain**
- sdth:ProgramStep

**has range**
- sdth:FileInstance


 
### sdth:producesDatframe {#model-producesdataframe}
An sdth:producesDataframe is used when an sdth:ProgramStep results in a new sdth:DataframeInstance.  This occurs when data are read from an external file or when data in an existing sdth:DataframeInstance is modified.  

**has domain**
- sdth:ProgramStep

**has range**
- sdth:DataframeInstance


 
### sdth:consumesDataframe {#model-consumesdataframe}
An sdth:consumesDataframe is used when an sdth:ProgramStep uses data from an existing sdth:DataframeInstance.  This occurs when data are saved to an external file or when data in an existing sdth:DataframeInstance is modified.  

**has domain**
- sdth:ProgramStep

**has range**
- sdth:DataframeInstance


 
### sdth:hasVarInstance {#model-hasvarinstance}
sdth:hasVarInstance is used to enumerate the sdth:VariableInstances in an sdth:DataframeInstance or an sdth:FileInstance.

**has domain**
- sdth:ProgramStep

**has range**
- sdth:VariableInstance

 
###  sdth:assignsVariable {#model-assignsvariable}

## Derivation and Elaboration {#model-derivation}
Derivation and Elaboration describe the lineage of a data entity.  Derivation is used when values in a data entity were changed to derive a new data entity.  Elaboration is used when metadata about a data entity changed, but its values remained the same.  


###  sdth:wasDerivedFrom {#model-wasderivedfrom}
sdth:wasDerivedFrom is used when the values of data in a data entity have changed.  sdth:wasDerivedFrom links a data entity to a pre-existing data entity that affected it.  

**has domain**
- sdth:FileInstance, sdth:DataframeInstance, sdth:VariableInstance

**has range**
- sdth:FileInstance, sdth:DataframeInstance, sdth:VariableInstance


 
###  sdth:elaborationOf {#model-elaborationof}
sdth:elaborationOf is used when an attribute of a data entity, such as a data format or name, has changed, but the values in the data entity have not changed.  sdth:elaborationOf specifies links a data entity to a pre-existing data entity with the same data values but different attributes.
