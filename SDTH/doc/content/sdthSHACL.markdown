# SHACL for SDTH

SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) [[shacl]] is a W3C standard for validating RDF graphs.  A SHACL schema is a set of constraints on types, properties, and values in an RDF graph.  SHACL libraries are available for programming languages, like Java and Python, and SHACL validation services, such as [SHACL Play!](https://shacl-play.sparna.fr/play/), are also available.

A SHACL schema for the elements of SDTH is available at [https://gitlab.com/c2metadata/sdth-shacl](https://gitlab.com/c2metadata/sdth-shacl).
