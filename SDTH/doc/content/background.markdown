# Background and Motivation

SDTH was created to provide a simple way to describe the key features of a data transformation script.  SDTH answers questions such as: “Which variables affected variable X?” and “Which variables were affected by file Y?”  

SDTH focuses on how data entities (variables, dataframes, and files) are related to each other and to the steps in a program that change them.
