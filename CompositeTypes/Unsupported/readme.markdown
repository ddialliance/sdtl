Describes an unsupported command. Commands may be unsupported for several reasons:

* Unsupported: something the parser understands, but does not describe
* Analytical: command that performs analysis and does not have any affect on the data contents or structure
* Unexpected: something the parser does not expect. Invalid syntax, at least as far as the parser is accurate. This might be a known transform command, but with unexpected or erroneous syntax.
