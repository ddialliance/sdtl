Describes recoding values in one or more variables according to a specified mapping.

The Recode command can either describe a recoding of one or more individual variables,
or a range of variables. When one or more individual variables are described, a new
variable name can be specified. In this case, the original variable is left alone, and
a new variable is created with the recoded values.
